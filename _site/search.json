Stock market correlation with presidential terms allows us to see the movement of the S&P 500 during periods of time. This dataset uses quantmod and dplyr to obtain all stock market data and movement. Although there are periods of time where the stock market falls or stagnates, it tends to move upwards in the long-term."
