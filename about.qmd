This project about the correlation of the stock market (S&P 500), and US presidents is located in a repository [here](https://github.com/aedan00/gspc-presidents).  

This project is also related to another past project [here](https://github.com/aedan00/gspc-project).

Both projects were created as a part of [Kane's Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
